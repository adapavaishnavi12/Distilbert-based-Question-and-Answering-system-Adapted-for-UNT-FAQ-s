      "{'context': 'The UNT Writing Center provides support for undergraduate and graduate writers across the disciplines. Our mission is to help students at all levels improve as writers. Here are some frequently asked questions about what we do and how to use our services. Everyone! We believe that all writers will benefit from sharing their work with a tutor. Whether you are an undergraduate student writing your first college paper or a graduate student working on a dissertation we can help. In addition to helping with coursework we can also help with resums cover letters and personal statements. We are excited to work with writers in the humanities and social sciences as well as writers in the physical and biological sciences. We also work with short and long writing projects at any stage. We have highly skilled undergraduate tutors from many different majors who were selected for their strong writing ability and their desire to help their peers. Tutors receive initial and ongoing training in writing genres citation conventions facilitating discussion and assessing drafts. We also have graduatewriting tutors who work exclusively with graduate students. Appointments for undergraduates are 30 minutes long. Graduate appointments are one hour if scheduled with a graduate tutor. Your tutor will want to start by chatting with you about your assignment or writing project. If you have a draft the tutor will want to go over it to get a sense of the paper as a whole. You and your tutor will decide together what to focus on in terms of revision. Here are just a few writing topics you might discuss Developing your ideas Creating and supporting an argument Understanding grammar rules Making your writing more clear Making your writing more concise Understanding citations and paraphrasing Developing structure and organization Writing introductions and conclusions. Please bring the assignment instructions if you have them. Bring a draft or we can help you brainstorm or start an outline. We have a few computers in our main center for use during appointments and you are always welcome to bring a laptop. We have three locations at UNT Sage Hall 150 Willis Library 250J Walkins only. Our main center in Sage Hall 150 is appointment only though during slower times of the semester or when we have cancellations you may be able to get in right away. Stop by or call 940.565.2563 to schedule an appointment. Our hours are from 900 a.m.  900 p.m. Monday  Thursday and from 900 a.m.  300 p.m. on Fridays. We offer evening walkins at Willis Library Sunday  Thursday from 500 p.m. to 900 p.m. You can stop by at 500 p.m. when the tutor arrives to sign up for a slot that nightwalkins are first come first served. All students may have up to 1 hour of instruction total per day i.e. one 30minute appointment in the main center and a 30minute appointment in the library or two 30minute appointments in the main center not backtoback. Graduate students working with our graduate tutors can schedule 1 hour of instruction per week either online or inperson. Yes! We have interactive online appointments in our main center from 900 a.m.  900 p.m. Monday  Thursday and from 900 p.m.  300 p.m. on Fridays. Please call 940.565.2563 or email us at WritingCenterunt.edu to schedule an online appointment. Our graduate tutors also offer online appointments for graduate students. Email GradWritingunt.edu to schedule an online appointment. Ideally we recommend seeing us early and often! The more appointments you have the more improvement you will likely see in your writing. We also recommend coming in to see us at multiple stages of writing allowing ample time after each appointment for revision. We also understand that the ideal may not always be possible but thats okaywell still be happy to work with you. Please keep in mind that if you have a long draft or a complex project we are not likely to get through all of it in one appointment. During an inperson session you can generally expect to work on about five pages though this varies. For online appointments it usually takes longer to get through the same draft versus inperson i.e. it may take an hour to work in detail on a fivepage draft so please plan accordingly.
